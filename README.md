A3U 0.1 Alpha

Scripts by Frett

A3U is a collection of scripts that can be added to any mission. It will provide immersive undercover gameplay.
It is written in such a way that it will also work with dynamic mission, such as ALiVE missions or DUWS.

Current features:

- You will be treated as a normal civilian, as long as you have your handgun holstered.
- There are a number of situation to which the AI will respond. AI will consider you hostile if
	- You wear body armour
	- You have a handgun raised 
	- You have a rifle raised or on your back (you can have an SMG in your backpack though)
	- You have a launcher raised or on your back
	- You have planted an explosive
	- You are close to an enemy and you run/sprint towards him
- You can quickly regain undercover status if none of the above condtions are true AND you are unnoticed by the enemy.
- If you have been noticed by the enemy while waving with your gun, it will be harder to regain undercover status.
- AI will keep an eye on you if you approach them too close
- AI will respond to gunfire in the area: if you have fired a weapon, don't stay around for too long!
